## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2018 - October 2018)

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, focusing on :

- Agile methodologies
- Object-oriented design
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development
- Pair programming
- XP values

#### University College London (start_date to end_date)

- PhD Chemistry (Astrochemistry)
- Thesis title: Formation of Alcohol on Interstellar Dust Grain Analogues
- This was an experimental PhD involving serious spanner skills (of the motor mechanic variety). I maintained a huge vacuum chamber that enabled me to recreate interstellar conditions (extremely low temperatures and pressures) and performed gas bombardment experiments on a small piece of graphite suspended in the middle of the chamber. This experience taught me very high levels of patience and the ability to process large volumes of data.
