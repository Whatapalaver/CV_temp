I am technically astute analyst with a strong reputation for being delivery-focussed, efficient and delivering system improvements and process reliability.

**BPP London** - CIMA full qualification (2006 - 2009)

#### University College London (2003 - 2006)

- PhD Chemistry (Astrochemistry)
- Thesis title: Formation of Alcohol on Interstellar Dust Grain Analogues
- This was an experimental PhD involving serious spanner skills (of the motor mechanic variety). I maintained a huge vacuum chamber that enabled me to recreate interstellar conditions (extremely low temperatures and pressures) and performed gas bombardment experiments on a small piece of graphite suspended in the middle of the chamber. This experience taught me very high levels of patience and the ability to process large volumes of data.

## Hobbies and Interests
I’m a medically trained accountant with a PhD in Astrochemistry but I could also be described as a serial dabbler with multiple full time interests.
I document almost all of these interests in one or more blogs.

**Fitness and Health** - My health and sporting exploits are featured on my [warriorwomen blog](http://warriorwomen.co.uk)
- **Powerlifting** - I have computed in a number of regional competitions and qualified for the All England Championships.
- **Ice Swimming** - Having been inspired by Wim Hof I have taken to swimming outdoors throughout the winter months. I take great pleasure in cracking the ice at Tooting Bec Lido and have been delighted to swim during snow flurries.
- **BJJ** - This is a relatively new addition to my sporting repertoire and I'm still fairly useless but have just got a new stripe on my white belt and am adept at the rear naked choke....
- **Running** - I used to be pretty serious about running (although always in a very slow and plodding fashion), now I am only encouraged to jog for Obstacle events such as Wolf Run.

**Allotment Gardening** - I have dreams of eventually settling into the life of a geeky smallholder, for now I have to settle for a few growbags at home and a local allotment. I occasionally document this on my [earthwoman blog](http://earthwoman.co.uk)

**Technical Blogging** - I've been a serial blogger for many years and have a number of blogs for sharing tutorials on technical issues of for training people in specific skills.

- *[NHS Excel Blog](http://nhsexcel.com) - designed to share specific excel tips and tricks for other NHS Accountants*
- *[Excel Pivots Blog](http://excelpivots.com) - tips and tricks focussed on the marvellous pivot table*
- *[Whatapalaver Blog](http://whatapalaver.co.uk) - assorted technical trickery explained. It's also where I have been documenting my coding journey with Makers*
