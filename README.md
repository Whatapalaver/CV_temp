## Dr Angela Wolff

I am an energetic and values-driven individual currently training with Makers, a Developer Bootcamp in London. I am also a qualified CIMA accountant and have had a number of Senior Finance roles within the NHS over the last 10 years. I have extensive experience in technical healthcare roles, covering areas such as acute finance commissioning, income reporting, PbR, reference costing, SLR, patient level costing and financial planning.

My intention is to retrain as a Developer, building on my existing strengths and expertise as a technically astute analyst with a strong reputation for being delivery-focussed and efficient, and plan to combine this with coding knowledge to enable me to design and create software solutions.

I am particularly motivated by the potential to harness software skills to improve areas of society whether that is health, fitness or social equality and I would like to ultimately secure a role where I will be doing meaningful, important work.

I also have mutiple interest such as ice-swimming or powerlifting that occupy me in my spare time - see [Hobbies and Interests](#hobbies-and-interests) for more details.

**Tech Skills :** Ruby, tSQL, HTML, CSS, MS Excel

## Skills

#### Analytical and Judgement Skills

A concise, logical thinker with an ability to exploit technical skills to solve problems rapidly and clearly.

- At North Central London CCGs I created a reporting suite that enabled HRG level drill down across all of our provider trusts using macros to automate the transformation of multi-format reports. Previously the reports has been restricted to high level values without the ability to analyse and interrogate. My system could run automatically providing instant access to patient level data
- At North West London CCGs I produced a 5 year planning template that was used across the entire sectore. Ensuring consistency of approach within organisations and an ability to consolidate reports for upward reporting.
- At Barts Health I produced SQL linked spreadsheets that could automate data refresh and therefore support analysis with out the risk of copy and paste errors.

#### Technical Skills

Advanced Excel and SQL data skills with a proven ability to transform vast, complex data into meaningful management reports.

tSQL / MS Query / SSIS - writing queries and procedures to automate processes. Large scale project examples include:
* scripting the financial reconciliation for a patient level costing project spanning multiple organisations and patient pathways (NWL Whole Systems)
* generating the trust income plans from the bottom-up, allowing all components of change (eg. growth) to be identified and reported. Process included version control to roll back changes

MS Excel / VBA - automating team processes to minimise replication of tasks and to eradicate user error. 

#### Communication

Ability to impart technical information clearly, to a range of specialists and senior managers. Honest approach resulting in trusted relationships with senior colleagues. Run regular lunch and learn sessions at work to encourage debate and knowledge share. I host a number of [technical blogs](#technical-blogging) where I write tutorials on key analytical skills.

#### Management

Provide strong, value driven leadership. Brought the NCL Acute Finance team through three major reorganisations and ensured continuity and quality of departmental output.

#### Continuous Development

Improvement focused - value continuous development both individually and departmentally. 

## Education

#### Makers (June 2018 - October 2018)

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, focusing on :

- Agile methodologies
- Object-oriented design
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development
- Pair programming
- XP values

**BPP London** - CIMA full qualification (2006 - 2009)

#### University College London (2003 - 2006)

- PhD Chemistry (Astrochemistry)
- Thesis title: Formation of Alcohol on Interstellar Dust Grain Analogues
- This was an experimental PhD involving serious spanner skills (of the motor mechanic variety). I maintained a huge vacuum chamber that enabled me to recreate interstellar conditions (extremely low temperatures and pressures) and performed gas bombardment experiments on a small piece of graphite suspended in the middle of the chamber. This experience taught me very high levels of patience and the ability to process large volumes of data.

**Open University** - BSc in Natural Sciences with Chemistry 1st Class Hons (1995 - 2000)

**Sheffield University** - 2nd MB Medicine (1989 - 1993)

**Headlands School Bridlington** - A levels in Chemistry (A), Physics (B), Biology (A) and AS Maths (1989)

## Hobbies and Interests
I’m a medically trained accountant with a PhD in Astrochemistry but I could also be described as a serial dabbler with multiple full time interests.
I document almost all of these interests in one or more blogs.

#### Fitness and Health 
My health and sporting exploits are featured on my [warriorwomen blog](http://warriorwomen.co.uk)
- **Powerlifting** - I have competed in a number of regional competitions and qualified for the All England Championships.
- **Ice Swimming** - Having been inspired by Wim Hof I have taken to swimming outdoors throughout the winter months. I take great pleasure in cracking the ice at Tooting Bec Lido and have been delighted to swim during snow flurries.
- **BJJ** - This is a relatively new addition to my sporting repertoire and I'm still fairly useless but have just got a new stripe on my white belt and am adept at the rear naked choke....
- **Running** - I used to be pretty serious about running (although always in a very slow and plodding fashion), now I am only encouraged to jog for Obstacle events such as Wolf Run.

#### Allotment Gardening
I have dreams of eventually settling into the life of a geeky smallholder, for now I have to settle for a few growbags at home and a local allotment. I occasionally document this on my [earthwoman blog](http://earthwoman.co.uk)

#### Technical Blogging
I've been a serial blogger for many years and have a number of blogs for sharing tutorials on technical issues of for training people in specific skills.

- *[NHS Excel Blog](http://nhsexcel.com) - designed to share specific excel tips and tricks for other NHS Accountants*
- *[Excel Pivots Blog](http://excelpivots.com) - tips and tricks focussed on the marvellous pivot table*
- *[Whatapalaver Blog](http://whatapalaver.co.uk) - assorted technical trickery explained. It's also where I have been documenting my coding journey with Makers*
